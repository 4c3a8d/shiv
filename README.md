# shiv ðŸ”ª
Shiv is a command line utility for building fully self-contained Python zipapps as outlined in [PEP 441](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0441/), but with all their dependencies included!

Shiv's primary goal is making distributing Python applications fast & easy.

### how to

Shiv has a few command line options of its own and accepts almost all options passable to `pip install`.

##### simple cli example

Creating an executable of aws-cli with shiv:

```sh
$ shiv -e awscli.clidriver:main -o aws awscli
$ ./aws --version
aws-cli/1.14.2 Python/3.6.1 Linux/3.10.0-514.21.2.el7.x86_64 botocore/1.8.6
```

##### complex example involving a wheel cache

Creating an interactive executable with a downloaded wheel of boto:

```sh
$ python3 -m pip download boto
Collecting boto
  File was already downloaded /tmp/tmp.iklsO1qyd3/boto-2.48.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
Successfully downloaded boto
$ shiv -o boto.pyz --find-links . --no-index boto
 shiv! ðŸ”ª
Collecting boto
Installing collected packages: boto
Successfully installed boto-2.48.0
 done
$ ./boto.pyz
Python 3.6.1 (default, Apr 19 2017, 21:58:41)
[GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-4)] on linux

>>> import boto

```

### installing

You can install shiv via `pip` / `pypi`

```sh
pip install shiv
```

You can even create a pyz _of_ shiv _using_ shiv!

```sh
python3 -m venv shiv
source shiv/bin/activate
pip install shiv
shiv -c shiv -o shiv shiv
```

### developing

We'd love contributions! Getting bootstrapped to develop is easy:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:linkedin/shiv.git
cd shiv
python3 setup.py venv
. activate
python3 setup.py develop
```

Don't forget to run and write tests:

```sh
pip install tox
tox
```

### gotchas

Zipapps created with Shiv are not cross-compatible with other architectures. For example, a `pyz` file built on a Mac will only work on other Macs, likewise for RHEL, etc.
